        <h2>Sunrise Mountain</h2>
        <p>Sunrise Mountain is located in the northeast of Arizona. Lodging can be found at the mountain, or in nearby cities like Pinetop or Show Low. Sunrise has three different peaks that comprise the full mountain, each having their own lifts and routes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunrise peak is the main area, having three lifts and the most routes. These routes are generally easier and are made up of blue and green difficulty levels. At the bottom of the peak is the entrance, parking area, and lodge with dining, rentals, and lessons.</li>
            <li>The second peak, Apache peak, is the highest elevation peak in the mountain. Standing at 11,100 feet, it is the bridge between the other two peaks and has a mix of easier and harder trails.</li>
            <li>The final peak is being reopened in 2022. Named Cyclone Circle, it contains the hardest runs Sunrise has to offer and is the furthest away from the central hub at the bottom of Sunrise Peak. Both Cyclone Circle and Apache Peak lead to the smaller lodge area of Cyclone Base.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, Sunrise offers a wide selection of trails with varying levels of difficulty, perfect for those who are just starting or those who want to refine their skills on a more difficult route.</p>
