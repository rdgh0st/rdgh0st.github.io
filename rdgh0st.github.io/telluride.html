    <h2>Telluride Mountain</h2>
    <p>Telluride Mountain is located in the southwest of Colorado. It is an extremely large mountain, and has several routes hubs, and even backcountry access.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are eight different basins with huib areas at Telluride, and there are 15 lifts all going to different parts of this incredibly large mountain.</li>
      <li>There are options for beginners with several greens and blues with slow areas near the center basin of the mountain. For those extremely skilled at snowboarding, the top of the mountain has backcountry access, and you can even service a helicopter to take you to the top of the mountain instead of using all the lifts.</li>
      <li>There are several restaurants spread throughout the mountain, so food is readily available regardless of which region you might want to explore.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While Telluride can certainly service beginner snowboarders, most of the features that make it special and distinct from other mountains on this sight can only be enjoyed by those who are extremely skilled and comfortable enough to do extremely difficult routes and backcountry.</p>
