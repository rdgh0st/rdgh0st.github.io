        <h2>Snowbowl Ski Resort</h2>
        <p>Snowbowl Ski Resort is located in Arizona, near Northern Arizona University. Lots of students choose NAU because of its proximity to snowbowl. Snowbowl has one peak, with some options for much more difficult routes if the rider travels there.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The left side of the peak is much smaller, and has lifts that only go to green or blue areas. On the other side, the rider has no choice but to go on at least one black route before transitioning to a blue.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the mountain has one lodge and a bar/restaurant. However, there are picnic areas throughout the easier side of the mountain, so packing lunch is an easy option.</li>
            <li>Because of snowbowl's short proximity to the valley and because of its relatively small amount of routes, it is often used by people coming up from the valley as a short day trip.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Snowbowl is great for either riders who are just starting or people who are extremely comfortable with hard routes, due to the disparity in its route difficulties. It is also perfect as a day trip destination from the valley.</p>
